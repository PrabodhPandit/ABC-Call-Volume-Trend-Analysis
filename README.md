# ABC-Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis

In this project, to improve customer engagement and enhance their overall experience, we will be using our analytical skills to understand the trends in the call volume of the CX team and derive valuable insights from it. We will also address the following questions:

Average Call Duration: Determine the average duration of all incoming calls received by agents.

Call Volume Analysis: Visualize the total number of calls received.

Manpower Planning (Day Shift): Propose a plan for manpower allocation during each time bucket (from 9 am to 9 pm) to reduce the abandon rate from the existing 30% to 10%.

Manpower Planning (Night Shift): Assuming that for every 100 calls that customers make between 9 am and 9 pm, they also make 30 calls at night between 9 pm and 9 am. Propose a manpower plan for each time bucket throughout the day, keeping the maximum abandon rate at 10%.
